# LinkedListLock

Create a three separate circular linked lists to represents a chain of lock. Every chain must have: 
the randomly generated common value,
non-repeating random values,
and only one value should be common in all three.

After creating lock, first chain should be reference point, and all other chains should be
rolled until all common values aligned vertically.
